# GWBasicVisualization
Visualizing GW-Basic source code, written in assembly, using [Roassal3](https://github.com/ObjectProfile/Roassal3) and [Pharo](http://pharo.org).

The following pictures show the invocation between the routines from the repository http://github.com/dspinellis/GW-BASIC
Each dot is a routine, each file is associated to a color. The first picture uses a simple grid layout while the second picture uses a force-based layout. Both pictures show the same results. 

This was done as a simple programming exercise. If you have a wishlist, enter it in as an issue.
